# This file is used to write your python files where each one could be executed from your terminal

## Take a look in the [hworld](commands/hworld.py) file as an example to generate executables

In order to start creating commands in dist directory, simply follow those steps:

 - Copy the `base.py` file and give it a name you'd like (this will be the command name)
 - Write the code you want in the **main** function (starting from line 14)
 - The list of `keys` could be used to accept additional arguments (see hworld example)
